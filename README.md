Unleashing the Power of HTTP APIs: The Http4s Library 
================================================

Once we learnt how to define Monoids, Semigroups, Applicative, Monads, and so on, it's time to 
understand how to use them to build a production-ready application. Nowadays, Many applications 
exposes APIs over an HTTP channel. So, it's worth to spend some time to study libraries implementing
such use case.

If we learnt the basics of functional programming using the Cats ecosystem, it's straightforward to
choose the `http4s` library to implement HTTP endpoints. Let's see how to implement some aspects of
HTTP APIs using it.

## Introduction

First thing first, we need a good example to work with. In this case, we need a domain model easy 
enough to allow us focusing on the exposition of simple APIs. 

So, imagine we've just finished watching the Snyder Cut of the Justice League movie, and we are very 
excited about the film. We really want to tell the world how much we enjoyed the movie, and then we 
decide to build our personal "Rotten Tomatoes" application (ugh...).

As we are very experienced developers, we chose to start coding from the backend. Hence, we began in
defining the resources we need in terms of domain.

For sure, we need a `Movie`, and a movie has a `Director`, many `Actors`, a `Synopsis`, and finally 
a `Review`. Without dwelling on the details, we can identify the following APIs among the others:

 * Getting all movies of a director (i.e., Zack Snyder)
 * Getting the list of actors of a movie
 * Adding a new director to the application

As we just finished the amazing course on [Cats on Rock The JVM](https://rockthejvm.com/p/cats), we
want to use a library built on the Cats ecosystem to expose the above APIs. Fortunately, the 
[http4s](https://http4s.org/) library is what we are looking for. So, let's get a deep breath, and
start diving into the world of functional programming applied to HTTP APIs. 

## Library Setup

We are going to use the version 0.21.20 of the http4s library. Even if Scala 3 is almost upon us, 
this version of http4s uses Scala 2.13 as target language.

The dependency we must add in the `build.sbt` file are a lot:

```scala
val Http4sVersion = "0.21.23"
val LogbackVersion = "1.2.3"
val MunitVersion = "0.7.20",
val MunitCatsEffectVersion = "0.13.0"
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s"      %% "http4s-blaze-server" % Http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s"      %% "http4s-circe"        % Http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s"      %% "http4s-dsl"          % Http4sVersion,
  "org.scalameta"   %% "munit"               % MunitVersion           % Test,
  "org.typelevel"   %% "munit-cats-effect-2" % MunitCatsEffectVersion % Test,
  "ch.qos.logback"  %  "logback-classic"     % LogbackVersion,
  "org.scalameta"   %% "svm-subs"            % "20.2.0"
)
```
